## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r explore, include = FALSE}
skimr::skim(lobsters)

siteyear_summary <- lobsters %>% group_by(site, year) %>% summarize(count_by_siteyear = n(),
                                                mean_size_mm = mean(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE),
                                                median_size_mm = median(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE),
                                                sd_size_mm = sd(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE))

```

## Included Summary Table


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
siteyear_summary %>% 
  kable()

## GG plot option

ggplot(data = siteyear_summary, aes(x = year, y = median_size_mm, color = site)) + geom_line()
ggsave(here("figures", "lobsters-line.png"))

```
```{r}

## another plot option

ggplot(siteyear_summary, aes(x = year, y= median_size_mm)) + geom_col() + facet_wrap(~site)
ggsave(here("figures", "lobsters-facet-site.png"))

```

## Summary 

There are `r nrow(lobsters)` total lobsters included in this report.
